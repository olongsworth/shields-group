All of the xyz coordinates are in the Coordinates folder. 
 
The Spreadsheets folder contains all of the wB97X-D and DLPNO-CCSD(T)/cc-pVNZ electronic energies (N=D,T,Q) as well as the ∆Gcorr values based on the scaled wB97X-D calculations, and the extrapolated DLPNO-CCSD(T) Complete Basis Set Gibbs Free Energies. Columns A and AC contain the original names of the structures. The energies in Column AA match up with the naming of the structures in the Figures, which are within 1 kcal/mol of the global minimum. 
 
Example. In the 2-methylthreitol Data spreadsheet, the first tab is labeled 2-methyltreitol. Column B contains the wB97X-D electronic energy and columns C-E contain the ∆Gcorr values from the frequency calculations (scaled by 0.971). Columns F-H contain the ∆Eel minimum and the ∆G217 K and ∆G298 K based on the wB97X-D calculation. Columns I-K contain the DLPNO-CCSD(T) electronic energies for the cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ, and cc-pVQZ basis sets. Columns L-N contain the extrapolated electronic energies. The extrapolation formulas are in Column R, rows 1-3.  Columns O-R contain the DLPNO-CCSD(T) relative electronic energies for the cc-pVQZ, CBS(DT), CBS (TQ), and CBS (DTQ). Columns S-V contain the relative ∆G˚ values at 217 K for the cc-pVQZ, CBS(DT), CBS (TQ), and CBS (DTQ) calculations and columns X-AA contain the relative ∆G˚ values at 298 K for the cc-pVQZ, CBS(DT), CBS (TQ), and CBS (DTQ) calculations. Column AB marks the structures within 1 kcal/mol of the minimum. In this first tab we find that there are three 20methylthreitol conformers within 1 kcal/mol of the minimum, the gfn2-1 structure (0 kcal/mol), the gfn2-3 structure (0.50 kcal/mol), and the gfn2-187 structure (0.89 kcal/mol). These are represented in Figure 3 by their ∆G˚298 K values, 0.00, 0.50, and 0.89 kcal/mol.
